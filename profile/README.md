## 📘 About OpenQQuantify

**OpenQQuantify** is a community-first tech organization devoted to building **open-source tools** that bridge the gap between complex scientific concepts and real-world application. Our work sits at the intersection of:

- Artificial Intelligence (AI)  
- Quantum Computing  
- Real-Time System Monitoring  
- Digital Twins & 3D Simulation  
- Electronics and RF Analysis  

We don’t just build software—we build learning platforms, experimentation toolkits, and frameworks designed to empower developers, researchers, engineers, and dreamers from all walks of life.

Founded by **Paul Savluc**, OpenQQuantify is more than a GitHub organization—it's a **movement** to make deep tech **transparent**, **collaborative**, and **impactful**.

## 🚀 Our First Projects

### 1. 🧠 Windows-WinDbg-CPU-Process-Toolkit  
[🔗 View on GitHub](https://github.com/openqquantify/Windows-WinDbg-CPU-Process-Toolkit)

This was our very first launch—a deep-dive tool into Windows internals, designed to automate **WinDbg** operations and monitor **CPU behavior** and **process activity**.

**Purpose:**  
To help developers, reverse engineers, and cybersecurity enthusiasts **visualize and control** how their software interacts with the Windows kernel.

**Features:**
- Automated WinDbg commands
- CPU/thread analysis
- Snapshot and trace generation
- Developer-friendly documentation

**Who it's for:**  
Windows developers, kernel-level debuggers, malware analysts, and anyone curious about what’s *really* happening inside the OS.

### 2. 🐧 Linux-Process-Analyzer  
[🔗 View on GitHub](https://github.com/openqquantify/Linux-Process-Analyzer)

A lightweight Python tool that brings **Linux process monitoring** into the hands of both beginners and experts. It provides insights into how your machine runs, which processes dominate memory or CPU, and how you can interact with them efficiently.

**Purpose:**  
To help users **understand process-level performance** on Linux, and build scripts or tools for system health, automation, or diagnostics.

**Features:**
- Cross-platform command line interface  
- Detailed CPU/memory analysis  
- Real-time updates  
- Pythonic API for integration in larger projects

---

### 3. 📡 RF-Signal-Analyzer  
[🔗 View on GitHub](https://github.com/openqquantify/RF-Signal-Analyzer)

An early step toward our vision of **automated electronics analysis**, this tool reads and interprets **radio frequency signals**—making RF analysis **accessible** for students, makers, and engineers without costly lab gear.

**Purpose:**  
To simulate and visualize RF data streams for experimentation and education.

**Features:**
- Signal capture and FFT analysis  
- Basic modulation recognition  
- Plotting for educational purposes  
- Lightweight Python framework

---

## 🧪 What’s Next?

Our current roadmap includes:

- ✨ **AI-powered schematic generators** using LLMs (OpenAI, LLaMA, Mistral)  
- 🛠️ **Text-to-electronics** simulation tools  
- 🌌 **3D environments** that visualize electronics in space, underwater, or inside industrial systems  
- 📚 Open educational content for STEM students and tech educators

Stay tuned—these projects will be released in **open alpha**, and you’ll be able to contribute, test, and shape them with us.
